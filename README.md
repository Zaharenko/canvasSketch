# Everyday Objects Series

Welcome to the Everyday Objects Series, a collection of canvas sketch projects that reimagine ordinary items as dynamic and vibrant works of digital art!

## Project 1: Pizza Box Redux (Skewing)

Pizza Box Redux is the inaugural project in the Everyday Objects Series. It breathes new life into the humble pizza box, transforming it into a canvas for dynamic animations and colorful designs.

### Description

Pizza Box Redux reimagines pizza boxes as dynamic and vibrant art pieces, setting the tone for an exciting exploration of everyday objects through digital art. Enjoy an interactive experience as the canvas sketch reacts to mouse movements, providing an engaging and immersive journey.

### Features

-   **Dynamic Animation**: The pizza box art comes to life with dynamic animations, giving a fresh twist to traditional pizza box designs.

-   **Colorful Palette**: Explore a diverse range of colors inspired by risograph printing, adding vibrancy and excitement to the artwork.

-   **Interactive Experience**: Enjoy an interactive experience as the canvas sketch reacts to mouse movements, providing an engaging and immersive journey.

## Project 2: Canvas Sketch Lithuania

This project is a dynamic canvas sketch inspired by the colors of the Lithuanian flag. It utilizes random noise and mathematical functions to create an abstract and vibrant artwork.

### Description

Canvas Sketch Lithuania is an interactive digital art piece that explores the visual aesthetics of the Lithuanian flag. It dynamically generates a colorful composition using various shades of yellow, green, and red, reminiscent of the Lithuanian national colors. The canvas sketch reacts to mouse movements, creating an engaging and immersive experience for viewers.

### Features

**Dynamic Color Palette**: The artwork features vibrant colors inspired by the Lithuanian flag, adding visual interest and depth to the composition.

**Interactive Experience**: Users can interact with the canvas sketch by moving their mouse, influencing the patterns and shapes created on the canvas in real-time.

**Randomized Patterns**: The canvas sketch utilizes random noise and mathematical functions to generate unique and unpredictable patterns, ensuring each viewing experience is different.

## Project 3: Audio Visualizer with Canvas

This is a JavaScript program for creating an audio visualizer using HTML5 Canvas. The visualizer responds to audio input, creating dynamic visual effects based on the music being played.

### Dependencies

canvas-sketch: A framework for creating generative art with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
canvas-sketch-util: Utilities for canvas-sketch.
eases: A library for easing functions.
random: Utility library for generating random numbers.

### Features

**Audio Playback**: Utilizes the HTML5 <audio> element for audio playback.
**Canvas Drawing**: Utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API for drawing dynamic visual effects.
**Audio Analysis**: Utilizes the Web Audio API to analyze audio frequency data.
**Dynamic Visual Effects**: Generates dynamic visual effects based on the audio frequency data, creating an immersive audio-visual experience.

## Project 4: Audio Visualizer with Canvas (part2)

This is a JavaScript project that creates an audio visualizer using HTML5 Canvas. The visualizer responds to audio input, generating dynamic visual effects based on the music being played.

### Description

The Audio Visualizer with Canvas project creates a mesmerizing visual representation of audio using HTML5 Canvas. It takes an audio input, analyzes its frequency data, and translates it into dynamic visual effects displayed on the canvas. Each circle in the visualization represents a specific frequency range, and its size and rotation are determined by the amplitude of the corresponding audio frequency.

### Dependencies

canvas-sketch: A framework for creating generative art with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
canvas-sketch-util: Utilities for canvas-sketch.
eases: A library for easing functions.
random: Utility library for generating random numbers.

### Features

**Dynamic Visualization**: The canvas displays dynamic visual effects that react to the audio input in real-time, creating an immersive experience for the viewer.

**Customizable Parameters**: The project allows customization of parameters such as the number of circles, their sizes, colors, and animation styles, providing flexibility to adapt the visualizer to different audio tracks and preferences.

**Interactive Controls**: Users can interact with the visualizer by clicking on the canvas to start/pause audio playback and visualization, adding an interactive element to the experience.

## Project 5: Interactive Particle Image Reconstruction

This JavaScript project reconstructs an image using interactive particles on an HTML5 Canvas. It allows users to interact with the canvas, influencing the behavior of particles and dynamically changing the appearance of the image.

### Description

The Interactive Particle Image Reconstruction project transforms images into dynamic particle simulations on an HTML5 Canvas. Users can interact with the canvas by clicking and dragging, affecting the movement and behavior of particles. The particles are attracted to specific areas of the image, creating an interactive and visually engaging experience. Additionally, the color of each particle is dynamically interpolated based on the colors of the underlying image, resulting in a vibrant and evolving visual representation.

### Features

**Interactive Particle Simulation**: Users can interact with the canvas using mouse movements, influencing the behavior and movement of particles in real-time.

**Image Reconstruction**: Images are reconstructed using particles, with each particle representing a pixel in the original image. The movement and behavior of particles create a dynamic and evolving representation of the image.

**Color Interpolation**: The color of each particle is dynamically interpolated based on the colors of the underlying image, resulting in a visually rich and vibrant representation.

### How to Run

To run the Pizza Box Redux project:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Install canvas-sketch-cli globally by running `npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g`.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
5. Run `canvas-sketch main.js` command.
6. The canvas sketch will be generated and opened in your default web browser.
7. If you need to run a project `npx canvas-sketch-cli NAME FILE --open`,
   or create a new one using the command `npx canvas-sketch-cli NAME FILE --open --new`

### Additional Information

**Project Exploration**: Dive into the world of creative coding and digital art by exploring these projects. Each project offers a unique perspective on everyday objects and visual storytelling.

**Interactive Engagement**: Immerse yourself in interactive experiences where your actions directly influence the outcome. Engage with the canvas through mouse movements, clicks, or other interactive controls to create dynamic and personalized visualizations.

**Creative Expression**: These projects serve as a platform for creative expression and experimentation. Feel free to modify parameters, explore different color palettes, or even create your own variations inspired by these projects.

**Continuous Development**: Stay tuned for updates and new additions to the Everyday Objects Series. The creative journey never ends, and there's always something new to explore and create.
